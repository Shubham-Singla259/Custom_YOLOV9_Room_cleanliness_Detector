# Custom_YOLOV9_Room_cleanliness_Detector
This project leverages a custom-trained YOLOv9 model to detect objects related to room cleanliness. Built with Gradio, it provides an interactive web interface where users can upload images and adjust detection parameters. The app returns images with annotated bounding boxes around detected objects, aiding in room organization tasks.
